You are the champion, my friend.
Hey now, you're an All Star, get your game on, go play!
You're a super star, that's what you are.
Baby you're a firework, come on show 'em what your worth!
Standing in the hall of fame, and the world's gonna know your name...
All you do is win win win no matter what
This is gonna be the best day of your life...
Baby we were born to run.
I ran, I ran so far away...
And the base keep runnin' runnin', and runnin' runnin', and runnin' runnin'...
Who run the world? You! Who run the world? You!
We could be heroes, just for one day...
We're gonna hear you roar...
You're going the distance! You're going for speed!
Don't stop believin', hold on to that feelin'...
You came in with the breeze, on Sunday Morning...
You're unbelievable (oh!)
Can't stop this thing you started...
Can't stop the feeling!
Got that sunshine in my pocket, Got that good soul in my feet...
Don't believe me just watch!
I just want to feel this moment...
Sometimes, I getta good feeling... 
I just wanna celebrate...
You never miss a beat, You're lighting on your feet...
You got 99 problems but runnin' won't be one, like what!
This is, the part where you break free...
Ain't no mountain high enough, ain't no valley low enough...
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger, stand a little taller...
This is your fight song, take back your life song...
Go big or go home...
It's a beautiful day, don't let it get away.
Keep on, with the force don't stop, Don't stop till you get enough.
